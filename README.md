# TwilioStatistics

Just a little application to get usage statistics from your Twilio-account (www.twilio.com), and for me to practice my Java.

Usage:
  1. Enter your account- and authorization tokens as provided by Twilio and click "connect"
  2. Select a date range (has to be at least two days at the moment :/)
  3. Choose "get messages" or "get calls" as desired. The number of imported records is displayed
  4. Export the data to a csv-file
  
Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks!
